# This script does the courtesy beep. It test for different conditions and
# alters the courtesy tone accordingly. The idea is that the operator can
# identify repeater status by the courtesy tone.
#
# Possible mutually exclusive states (determines `base' tone):
#
# Repeater idle (normal)       
#   tones 784 75 10 1318 75 10 1046 75 10
#
# IRLP active (in call) -- add a trailing low dit
#   tones 784 75 10 1318 75 10 1046 75 120 784 120 20
#
# EchoLink active (in call) -- add a trailing high dit
#   tones 784 75 10 1318 75 10 1046 75 120 1318 120 20
#
# Phone patch active -- let's give just a short discrete dit          
#   tones 1046 75 10
# 
# Note: In the future maybe support added tones for special conditions such
#       as power outages, etc.
